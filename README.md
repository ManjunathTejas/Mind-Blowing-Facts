# Mind-Blowing-Facts
This is a Hello World-esque Alexa Skill that says a really obvious and dumb fact when invoked. 

# Setup
To run this code you will need to deploy the code on AWS Lambda and configure an Alexa Skill to use it

# Examples
User: "Alexa, ask brain power to blow my mind"
Alexa: " Did you know women have a higher chance of getting pregnant than men"
